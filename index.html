    <h1>Console Screen</h1>
    <p style="font-size:20px"><i>Visual studio code is a programming platform on which we use to code web pages, but unlike brackets it has a simpler and easy to use syntax. It must be downloaded through the website, then opened as a download. A file must be created and after that, one does the following -- File -> Open folder -> Open the folder named. Then they can create a new file and start writing code.</i></p>
    <p style="font-size:20px"><i>The console screen is where information associated with the web page is printed but is not visible to the user. Console is useful for printing an error, messages, warnings or used to simply print information the programmer does not wish the user to see, eg. for testing purposes and so on.</i></p>
